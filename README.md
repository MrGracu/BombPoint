# BombPoint
 BombPoint - simple command line game  
 
  The game is about collecting points as they appear. After collecting a point, an additional obstacle appears on the map, which should be avoided. The number of points that you need to earn to reach the next level is displayed. Sometimes it can happen that a point appears between obstacles so that it will not be possible to get to it. Use the "disappearing" available in the game, which will remove the obstacle in front of you. After collecting twelve points, the player receives an additional disappearance. The game lasts as long as the player is alive.  
  
  A refreshed version written in C ++ is available at [this link](https://gmika.pl/cpp.html). The performance has been improved and the window "blinking" has been fixed.
  
  If there is a problem with the display of characters (they do not look like the pictures below), it may be enough to change the font in the command line settings to "**Raster Fonts**".
  
## Works on systems
